This project implements Kruskal's Algorithm in Python to find the Minimum Spanning Tree "MST" of a connected, undirected graph. 
The algorithm uses a Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure, and the edges are sorted using Merge Sort, which provides an efficient 
time complexity for sorting: O(nlogn).
